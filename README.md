# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition using RAVDESS, CREMA, TESS, and SAVEE Datasets
Description:
This Python notebook presents an in-depth exploration of speech emotion recognition using a combination of the RAVDESS, CREMA, TESS, and SAVEE datasets. Emotion recognition from speech has numerous applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, affective computing, and mental health assessment. This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
Key Features:
Utilizes multiple datasets for robustness and diversity in emotion representation.
Demonstrates data preprocessing techniques specific to speech data.
Implements various machine learning and deep learning models for emotion recognition.
Provides thorough evaluation metrics and analysis for model performance assessment.
TO Run this notebook jupyter notebook and python 3.10 or higher is required, along with libraries: NumPy,pandas,librosa,scikit-learn,Keras
